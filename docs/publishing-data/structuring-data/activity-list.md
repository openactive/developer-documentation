# Activity list

## Example use

```text
"activity": {
  "id": "https://openactive.io/activity-list/#aba839fb-5cd2-4042-b651-c09c86bce1e2",
  "type": "Concept",
  "prefLabel": "Walking Netball",
  "inScheme": "https://openactive.io/activity-list/activity-list.jsonld"
}
```

## Why referencing the activity list is important

Without reference to the activity list, events and facilities are far less useful, as they are extremely difficult to accurately categorise.

Categorisation is especially important when it comes to powering discovery, as users who are not sure what they are looking for browse by activity rather than just searching using keywords.

## Common strategies

Use the activity notation to match activities manually in your backend.

Create a drop-down of activities in your frontend, against your internal activity list if you already have one.

## What if an activity doesn't match

Use EMD fork, and if not raise it on this spreadsheet
