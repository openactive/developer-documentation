# Data Feeds

## Overview

To take advantage of the OpenActive ecosystem of data users, data must be published via open data feeds.

These feeds must be published using the OpenActive Realtime Paged Data Exchange \(RPDE\) specification, which provides a mechanism to allow systems to synchronise database state in near-realtime.
