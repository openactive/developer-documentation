# Data Quality

As OpenActive continues to scale, the range of data publishers and the number and variety of opportunities for sport and physical activity has expanded significantly.&#x20;

Feedback from data users has highlighted areas of improvement for the end-user experience when searching for activities. Additionally, the initiative needs a consistent approach to assess how OpenActive data could support new use cases.&#x20;

The [OpenActive Data Quality Reporting Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LplQ1UmssmgOw61k7JNqfPyaJ6qOYSp1SC19iL0gC9g/edit?usp=sharing) outlines our approach to data quality across the initiative.

The [Data Visualiser](https://visualiser.openactive.io/) allows you to explore data quality for a specific feed.

The initial focus is on ensuring the "what", "where" and "when" of opportunities is clearly defined in the data, to meet the main use cases of discovery and booking.

However, this is an area of ongoing work and additional metrics will be developed in collaboration with the [OpenActive W3C Community Group](https://w3c.openactive.io/).
