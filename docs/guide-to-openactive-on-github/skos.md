# SKOS

The [Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System) is used to structure a number of OpenActive [Controlled Vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary), and is supported by repos with the topic `skos`. For a list of OpenActive SKOS vocabularies, see the [Controlled Vocabularies page](controlled-vocabularies.md).

* \*\*\*\*[**iqvoc**](https://github.com/openactive/iqvoc): A SKOS editor, customised for OpenActive use.
* [**skos.js**](https://github.com/openactive/skos.js)**:** JavaScript library wrapping OpenActive JSON-LD with functions.
* [**activity-list-xml-json**](https://github.com/openactive/activity-list-xml-json)**:** Takes XML-encoded activity input and converts it into a JSON-LD representation.
* \*\*\*\*[**concept-scheme-restriction-generator**](https://github.com/openactive/concept-scheme-restriction-generator)**:** Outputs complete Concept Scheme files from ConceptSchemeRestrictions. In other words, given a parent Concept Scheme and a list of attributes to exclude from it, generates a Concept Scheme consisting of only those attributes which remain.
