# Documentation

The `documentation` topic is used for ... well, documentation, such as the GitBook you are now reading.

* [**developer-documentation**](https://github.com/openactive/developer-documentation)**:** Repo supporting this site.
* [**booking-swagger**](https://github.com/openactive/booking-swagger)**:** Swagger API documentation of the [Open Booking Specification](https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/). Note that this needs to be updated to reflect the latest version of the specification.
