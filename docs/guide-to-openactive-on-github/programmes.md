# Programmes

A 'Programme' is defined formally in the [Opportunity specification](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#programmes-and-brands) as 'a means of organising and running a Physical Activity' - typically as the result of a product-development exercise by a sport or leisure operator. Repos concerned with OA Programmes are tagged with `programme,` and tend to be quite small and simple.
