# Implementing booking

{% hint style="warning" %}
Implementations of the Open Booking API are currently being developed through collaboration within the OpenActive technical community. This is especially important so that the current development work on the [OpenActive Test Suite](test-suite.md) can take into account feedback from real implementations. Please see the [#openactive-test-suite slack channel for more information](https://slack.openactive.io/).

If youâ€™re interested in implementing the Open Booking API, then please [get in touch](https://bookwhen.com/openactive) and announce yourself on the `#implementation-forum` [Slack channel](https://slack.openactive.io/).
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites for Open Booking API

In order to build the Open Booking API, you must first have built both [Open Opportunity Data Feeds](../publishing-data/data-feeds/), and created a [Dataset Site](../publishing-data/dataset-sites.md).

## Implementation guidance

For .NET, a full implementation tutorial is available: [https://tutorials.openactive.io/open-booking-sdk/](https://tutorials.openactive.io/open-booking-sdk/).

For other languages, it is best to use the [Open Booking API CR3](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/) specification as an implementation reference.

### .NET, PHP and Ruby Libraries

Several libraries are available that greatly simplify implementation of the Open Booking API.

The table below lists the available OpenActive libraries:
