## Handling the complexity of a Sports Hall

If a sports hall could host both 5-a-side and badminton, the complexity of this double-purpose is hidden in the booking system. The data simply presents available badminton courts and available five-a-side pitches as separate inventory.  When a five-a-side pitch is booked for an hour slot, the number of available five-a-side pitches and the number of available badminton courts at that time both decrease and are updated in the feeds.
